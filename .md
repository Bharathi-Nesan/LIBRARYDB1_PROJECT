#  Library Database Management Project

This project is a relational database design and implementation for a Library Management System using MySQL. It helps organize books, authors, categories, members, and loan history using normalized tables and proper relationships.

##  Objectives

- Design a normalized relational schema using SQL
- Implement relationships:
  - One-to-Many: Categories → Books, Members → Loans
  - Many-to-Many: Books ↔ Authors (via BookAuthors)
- Use constraints: PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT, UNIQUE
- Populate the database with sample data
- Visualize the structure using an ER (Entity-Relationship) Diagram

##  Tables

- `Categories` – Stores book categories (e.g., Fiction, Science)
- `Authors` – Stores author names and bios
- `Books` – Stores book titles, ISBNs, and category references
- `BookAuthors` – Many-to-Many junction table between books and authors
- `Members` – Library members with names, emails, join dates
- `Loans` – Tracks books issued to members

##  Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench
- SQL (DDL & DML)
- GitHub (version control and sharing)

##  Project Structure

   - README.md - Project overview
   - schema.sql - SQL script to create tables
   - data.sql - SQL script to insert sample data
   - ER-diagram.png - Entity Relationship Diagram 


##  How to Use

1. Create a database in MySQL (e.g., `librarydb`)
2. Run `schema.sql` to create all tables
3. Run `data.sql` to populate them with sample data
4. Open `ER DIAGRAM1.mwb` to visualize table relationships
